Any crypto wallet is basically just a combination of 12 or 24 words. 
The amount of combinations is so vast that to randomly generate the same word phrase twice is almost impossible. 
However, there's still a slim chance of creating a wallet that has already been created, used, and has funds on it.

CoinJack is a Windows application developed to test this theory in practice.
It generates random seed phrases and checks if corresponding wallets have funds.

CoinJack has a vast functionality:
1) Supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum-based tokens (like USDT, etc), Solana;
2) Supports various seed lengths (12/24);
3) Allows to adjust request intervals (not to flood the servers and get your IP banned);
4) Allows to check the balances of a specific wallet;
5) Allows to calculate the checksum of the given 11/23 word combinations (Just a fun feature to play around with).

CoinJack uses either offline database or online third-party blockchain explorers to check balances (hence requires internet connection).
You can test CoinJack by checking the balance of any known wallet (like "abandon x 11, about") and compare the generated addresses and balances to any other crypto wallet apps (like TrustWallet).

Developers of CoinJack do not condone stealing! Creating wallets and looking up balances is not a crime. Stealing funds is!
When a non-zero balance wallet is found, we advise not to spend the funds but merely appreciate the unbelievably low odds of this event and share your story online.
