Any crypto wallet is basically just a combination of 12 or 24 words. 
The amount of combinations is so vast that to randomly generate the same word phrase twice is almost impossible. 
However, there's still a slim chance of creating a wallet that has already been created, used, and has funds on it.

CoinJack is a Windows application developed to test this theory in practice.
It generates random seed phrases and checks if corresponding wallets have funds.

CoinJack has a vast functionality:
1) Supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum-based tokens (like USDT, etc), Solana;
2) Supports various seed lengths (12/24);
3) Allows to adjust request intervals (not to flood the servers and get your IP banned);
4) Allows to check the balances of a specific wallet;
5) Allows to calculate the checksum of the given 11/23 word combinations (Just a fun feature to play around with).

There are bunch of scam brute force programs on the internet that claim to make you rich, but all they do is generate seed phrases at high speed.
To check balances at this rate, you would need to run your own blockchain explorer locally. It would require an expensive hardware and terrabytes of ssd storage.

CoinJack uses online third-party blockchain explorers to check balances (hence requires internet connection).
You can test CoinJack by checking the balance of any known wallet (like "abandon x 11, about") and compare the generated addresses and balances to any other crypto wallet apps (like TrustWallet).

Developers of CoinJack do not condone stealing! Creating wallets and looking up balances is not a crime. Stealing funds is!
When a non-zero balance wallet is found, we advise not to spend the funds but merely appreciate the unbelievably low odds of this event and share your story online.
